## ✨ What’s inside

- Static site (HTML/CSS/JS) with a few self-contained apps:
  - **PragyaYantra/** – Generative AI web app modules (YantraWrite/Chat/Attach/Doc/Query/Code).
  - **Quiz/** – Lightweight quiz demo.
  - **project/** – Project pages and assets.

> Tip: Each app is designed to run as plain static files — open the `index.html` in a browser or serve locally.

## 🧱 Tech stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

## 🚀 Quick start (local)

You can just open `index.html`, but using a local server avoids CORS issues:

```bash
# Option A: Python (built-in)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Option B: Node (http-server)
npm i -g http-server
http-server -p 8080
